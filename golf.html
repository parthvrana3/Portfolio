    <h2>My Golf Page</h2> 
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is golf. I have been playing since I was five. Now, I participate in tourtaments and play on my school's team. One reason why I like golf so much is because it gives you an opportunity to go outside and see nature. It is also good excersise to walk around the entire course. Additionally, I like it because it provides a good oppurinity to see friends. To conclude, golf is one of my favorite hobbies. </p>
